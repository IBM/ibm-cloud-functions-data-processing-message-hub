# OpenWhisk Hands On - OpenWhisk and Message Hub
Learn how to [create Message Hub data processing apps](https://github.com/IBM/openwhisk-data-processing-message-hub/wiki) with Apache OpenWhisk on IBM Bluemix. This tutorial will take about 10 minutes to complete.

You should have a basic understanding of the OpenWhisk programming model. If not, [try the action, trigger, and rule demo first](https://github.com/IBM/openwhisk-action-trigger-rule). You'll also need a Bluemix account and the latest [OpenWhisk command line tool (`wsk`) installed and on your PATH](docs/OPENWHISK.md).

When complete, move on to more complex serverless applications, such as those named _OpenWhisk 201_ or tagged as [_openwhisk-use-cases_](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aopenwhisk-use-cases+org%3AIBM&type=Repositories).

# Message Hub data processing with OpenWhisk
The example shows how to write actions receive data from Message Hub, aggregate those messages, and send data back to Message Hub. It also shows how to sequences with triggers and rules to link units of logic in a series.

Steps

1. [Provision Message Hub](#1-provision-mysql)
2. [Create OpenWhisk actions, triggers, and rules](#2-create-openwhisk-actions-triggers-and-rules)
3. [Test new message events](#3-test-new-message-events)
4. [Delete actions, triggers, and rules](#4-delete-actions-triggers-and-rules)
5. [Recreate deployment manually](#5-recreate-deployment-manually)


# 1. Provision Message Hub
Log into Bluemix, provision a [Message Hub](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/message-hub) instance, and name it `kafka-broker`. On the "Manage" tab of your Message Hub console create two topics: _in-topic_ and _out-topic_.

Copy `template.local.env` to a new file named `local.env` and update the `KAFKA_INSTANCE_NAME`, `SRC_TOPIC`, and `DEST_TOPIC` values for your instance if they differ. Update the `API_KEY`, `USER`, and `PASSWORD` values from the "Credentials" tab.

# 2. Create OpenWhisk actions, triggers, and rules
`deploy.sh` is a convenience script reads the environment variables from `local.env` and creates the OpenWhisk actions, triggers, and rules on your behalf. Later you will run these commands yourself.

```bash
./deploy.sh --install
```
> **Note**: If you see any error messages, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

> **Note**: `deploy.sh` will be replaced with [`wskdeploy`](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-wskdeploy) in the future. `wskdeploy` uses a manifest to deploy declared triggers, actions, and rules to OpenWhisk.

# 3. Test new message events
To test, invoke the first action manually. Open one terminal window to poll the logs:
```bash
wsk activation poll
```

And in a second terminal, invoke the action:
```bash
wsk action invoke --blocking --result write-to-cloudant
```

# 3. Test new message events
There are two helper scripts that simulate a message producer and a message consumer.

```bash
# Produce a message, will trigger the sequence
./kafka_publish.sh

# Consume a message after processing is complete
./kafka_consume.sh
```

# 4. Delete actions, triggers, and rules
Use `deploy.sh` again to tear down the OpenWhisk actions, triggers, and rules. You will recreate them step-by-step in the next section.

```bash
./deploy.sh --uninstall
```

# 5. Recreate deployment manually
This section provides a deeper look into what the `deploy.sh` script executes so that you understand how to work with OpenWhisk triggers, actions, rules, and packages in more detail.

## 5.1 Bind Kafka package with credential parameters
Make the Kafka instance in Bluemix available as an event source.

```bash
wsk package refresh
wsk package create kafka
wsk package bind kafka kafka-out-binding \
  --param api_key ${API_KEY} \
  --param kafka_rest_url ${KAFKA_REST_URL} \
  --param topic ${DEST_TOPIC}
wsk package get --summary kafka-out-binding
```

## 5.2 Create Kafka message trigger
Create the `kafka-trigger` trigger that listens for new messages.

```bash
wsk trigger create kafka-trigger \
  --feed /_/Bluemix_${KAFKA_INSTANCE_NAME}_Credentials-1/messageHubFeed \
  --param isJSONData true \
  --param topic ${SRC_TOPIC}
```

## 5.3 Create action to consume message
Upload the `mhget-action` action as a single file Node.js action. This downloads messages when they arrive via the trigger.

```bash
wsk action create mhget-action actions/mhget/mhget.js
```

## 5.4 Create action to aggregate and send back message
Upload the `mhpost-action` action as a zipped action, in order to include dependencies that are not in the default Node.js environment on OpenWhisk. This aggregates information from the action above, and sends the summary JSON back to Kafka.

```bash
DIR=`pwd`
cd actions/mhpost
npm install --loglevel=error
zip -r mhpost.zip *
cd ${DIR}
wsk action create kafka/mhpost-action actions/mhpost/mhpost.zip --kind nodejs:6
```

## 5.5 Create sequence that links get and post actions
Declare a linkage between the `mhget-action` and `mhpost-action` in a sequence named `kafka-sequence`.

```bash
wsk action create kafka-sequence --sequence mhget-action,kafka-out-binding/mhpost-action
```

## 5.6 Create rule that links trigger to sequence
Declare a rule named `kafka-inbound-rule` that links the trigger `kafka-trigger` to the sequence named `kafka-sequence`.

```bash
wsk rule create kafka-inbound-rule kafka-trigger kafka-sequence
```

# Troubleshooting
Check for errors first in the OpenWhisk activation log. Tail the log on the command line with `wsk activation poll` or drill into details visually with the [monitoring console on Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard).

If the error is not immediately obvious, make sure you have the [latest version of the `wsk` CLI installed](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli). If it's older than a few weeks, download an update.
```bash
wsk property get --cliversion
```
